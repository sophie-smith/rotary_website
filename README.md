# rotary_website
This repository consists of the scripts for the home page and sample company page for the Rotary Club's Home and Lifestyle Show. The website serves to list all the participants in this show. The user is able to click on a specific company name which routes them to a separate page with a video introducing the company and a tour via Google Maps of its interior (if available).
